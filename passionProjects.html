        <h1>Passion Projects & Dev Hobbies</h1>

        <h2>GameDev</h2>
        <p> 
            My hobby is working on projects in the Unity game engine, and also occassionally the RenPy engine as well. 
            These engines use C# and python scripts respectively. I primarily use Unity for 3D game projects, whereas RenPy
            is an engine designed for Visual Novels. I have a link to a small Unity repo as well for those interested. 
            <a href="https://github.com/joeikedo/Project-Boost">(Link to small Unity game Repo)</a>. I have also included some
            videos and images below.
        </p>

        <div class="videoWithDescription">
            <video controls loop autoplay width="550">
                <source src="media/game_animation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
            </video>

                I modeled and rigged this character in Blender (more on that below), and imported the asset to the Unity engine.

                of the UI via Python scripting.

        <h2>Computer Graphics Modeling</h2>
        <p>My 3D modeling hobby also intersects nicely with my gamedev pursuits. I create models and assets in 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)">Blender</a>, and from there can import them 
            into a Unity project library. I am also getting into designing my own 2D UI elements as well, which Blender 
            also supports. A few of my model projects are included below.
